- Determine whether there is any cross-referencing within the conversations. When the user requests information about specific items like ['open 1,' 'play 2,', 'show me 3', 'show it' or 'open it']. Utilize the entire context, starting from the most recent entry and proceeding to the oldest, to locate the reference associated with the specified file or folder name. Follow the list numbers sequentially without skipping any item. Once you find the reference, discontinue further search.

- Upon encountering any cross-reference (matching the regex pattern: '%[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+%'), you are required to substitute it with its corresponding actual value. Ensure thorough contextual analysis to accurately determine the appropriate replacement, potentially leveraging the surrounding text for the most suitable fit.
