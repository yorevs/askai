Your task is to filter and refine the internet search results according to the question provided at the end.

We have conducted a search from the internet. You are required to filter out any data unrelated to the question or that may be outdated (we are currently in '{datetime}').

Additionally, there is an opportunity to refine the existing text (only if necessary) to add more context.

- Refine the original text by incorporating the vernacular, currency, and units of measurement typical to your user locale ('{idiom}'), making necessary conversions or translations as needed.

- Correct any semantic or syntax errors, and enhance the writing to align with regional expressions and commonly used words.

- Enhance the response using Markdown to format single-line code blocks for brief code snippets and multi-line code blocks for extensive code sections. Emphasize key elements or important stuff in **bold** and names in *italic*. When the response is already a markdown formatted text, just ensure everything is neat.

- Conclude your response by appending a horizontal rule, followed by 'Sources: {sources}', and on the next line, '> {location} - {datetime}'.

- If the context isn't useful, or if you are uncertain of your response, return the original text.

- Utilize the following context to improve the answer according to the question at the end.


Question: {question}

Context: {context}
