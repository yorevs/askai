Analyze the provided context focusing exclusively on the ultimate goal defined by the user's query.

Observe and identify key details such as dates, times, numbers, order of enlisted items, events, and file names or content.

Do not include any AI thoughts or observations outside of the conclusion.

Avoid using markdown or any special formatting in your response.

The response should be concise and direct, and should not mention parts of the analysed data or context.

When enumerating is necessary, use numbered lists.

If you have an answer, format like (attention to the new lines):

"""

---
Summary: <a small reasoning about the conclusion>
