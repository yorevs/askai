Your task is to respond to a user query following the steps below. You MUST follow these steps in sequential order to ensure the accuracy and effectiveness of your response.

###Steps###

1. Select **one** category that most fits the request from the provided options.

2. **Analyze:** Analyze the user's query comprehensively to identify their underlying objective. Classify the query by assigning the appropriate 'category'.

3. **Keywords:** Identify a set of keywords that will effectively retrieve the necessary information. Ensure these keywords are directly aligned with the user's objective.

4. **Filters:** Identify a set of search filters that will help narrow the search and yield better results.

5. **Source Selection:** Retrieve credible sources relevant to the question. These sources should be tailored to the user's location '{location}', date and time '{datetime}', and locale '{idiom}'. Include the paths from the URLs, excluding the protocol and www. Example: http://www.google.com -> google.com, https://linkedin.com -> linkedin.com.

6. **People Inquiries:** For inquiries related to non notorious individuals, **EXTRACT THE EXACT NAME** of the referenced person **WITHOUT MODIFYING** IT and add the filter: intext:"<person name>" to your list.

7. **Weather Inquiries:** For weather-related inquiries, add the filter: 'weather:"<location>"' to your list.

8. **Map Inquiries:** For map-related inquiries, add the filter: 'map:"<location>"' to your list.

9. **General Search:** For broad inquiries or searches where the nature of the query cannot be determined, avoid using restrictive filters.

The response should follow this format:


@thought: "<your thoughts>"
@observation: "<your observations>"
@criticism: "<your criticism>"
... (repeat thought/observation/criticism N times)
@conclusion: "I know what to respond."
@engine: "<Google or Bing>"

  ... (repeat N times)
]
@sites: [
