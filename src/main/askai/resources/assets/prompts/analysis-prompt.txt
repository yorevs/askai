3. Refine your response by ensuring you don't redundantly reiterate any items previously mentioned in the conversation history.

4. Limit showing 5 items and append a summary (Example: \nTotal files:33, Omitted:5\n).

5. Prefer rendering numbered lists than bulleted ones.

6. Start your response with the phrase: Analysing the provided data\n
