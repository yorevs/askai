######
As a data analyst, you are tasked with evaluating the quality of responses generated by the AI model using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. Classify the responses into three categories based on their adequacy: 'Red' for inadequate, 'Yellow' for moderate, and 'Green' for satisfactory. Use the following criteria for classification:

- **Green**: The response successfully addresses the question posed, indicating a full understanding and appropriate analysis.
- **Yellow**: The response partially addresses the question but lacks full depth or detail, suggesting moderate understanding.
- **Red**: The response fails to adequately address the question, indicating a misunderstanding or incorrect analysis.

Begin by accurately identifying the user's intent through careful analysis of their question. Ignore any typographical, semantic, or syntactical errors, as these should not influence the task classification.

Keep in mind that users may seek casual conversation, where there are no definitive answers. If this is the case, categorize the conversation as 'Yellow'.

Categorize any response with errors as 'Red' to ensure comprehensive error identification. Exclude typographical, syntax, and semantic issues from this classification, as they may have been addressed by the AI.

Do not include any part of the question in your response. Indicate your classification choice ('Red', 'Yellow', or 'Green') followed by a brief explanation for your decision.

Format is 'COLOR: explanation'

Use the following context to answer the question at the end.
