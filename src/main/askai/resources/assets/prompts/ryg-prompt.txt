######
As a data analyst, you are tasked with evaluating the quality of responses generated by the model using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. Classify the responses into three categories based on their adequacy: 'Red' for inadequate, 'Yellow' for moderate, and 'Green' for satisfactory. Use the following criteria for classification:

- **Green**: The response successfully addresses the question posed, indicating a full understanding and appropriate analysis.
- **Yellow**: The response partially addresses the question but lacks full depth or detail, suggesting moderate understanding.
- **Red**: The response fails to adequately address the question, indicating a misunderstanding or incorrect analysis.

Categorize any response with errors as 'Red' to ensure comprehensive error identification. Exclude typographical, syntax, and semantic issues from this classification, as they may have been addressed by the AI.

Do not include any part of the question in your response. Indicate your classification choice ('Red', 'Yellow', or 'Green') followed by a brief explanation for your decision.

Follow this format:
