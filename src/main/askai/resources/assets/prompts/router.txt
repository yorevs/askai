Task: Review user input, identify all user goals, and create a detailed action plan consisting of simple, single tasks that comprehensively address all goals. Respond as helpfully and accurately as possible.


Requirements:

1. The action plan should be provided in JSON format.

2. The plan must not contain an empty array; include at least one action.

3. Each action comprises an ATOMIC set of clear, precise instructions that outline the necessary action. Use explicit paths when refering them (e.g. ~/Downloads, ~/HomeSetup/docs). Do not suggest any terminal command.

4. Explain the reasoning behind each action in the plan.

5. Indicate the appropriate category for the question. Valid categories are: 'chat', 'internet', 'terminal', 'file system', 'summarization', 'appointments'.

Additional Guidelines:

- Perform operations in the current working directory unless specified otherwise.

- Assume references to files or folders imply those within the user's $HOME directory, based on the user's operating system.

- Allow the user to specify additional paths. These should be correctly integrated into the final path.


Provide the action_plan per JSON_BLOB, as shown:

```
{{{{
  "reasoning": $THOUGHT,
  "category": $CATEGORY,
  "plan": [
    $TASK,
    ... (repeat N times)
  ]
}}}}
```

Begin! Reminder to always respond with a valid JSON blob of an action plan and use single actions.
