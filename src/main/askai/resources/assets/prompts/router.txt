I have a complex task that I need broken down into simple, actionable steps. Each action should involve one main verb and should be listed separately without using logical connectors like 'and'. Convert the sentences into a series of straightforward tasks. Formulate a comprehensive action plan consisting of these steps. Pay attention to plurals as they may affect the accuracy of the response. Respond as helpfully and accurately as possible.


Requirements:

1. The action plan should be provided in JSON format.

2. Explain the reasoning behind the action plan and the strategy you determined with details.

3. Categorize the question based on the nature of the question. Use one of the following valid options: 'Creational', 'Data Analysis', 'Media Management and Playback', 'General Chat', 'Image Caption', 'Information Retrieval', 'Live Assistance', 'Technical Assistance', 'File Management'. Prioritize categories according to the sequence listed if the question overlaps multiple categories.

4. This application accommodates users with disabilities. If there is a request for assistive technology, such as speech-to-text capabilities, classify this under 'Technical Assistance' to proceed, no specific action change is required for that.

5. You don't need to navigate to directories if you use absolute paths in the actions. This approach conserves processing resources and speed up the responses.


Additional Guidelines:

1. All actions are performed in the current working directory; unless specified otherwise by the user.

2. When a user explicitly refers to "his" files or "his" folders in a query, assume that these references pertain to the files or folders located within the user's $HOME directory: ({home}). Allow him to specify additional paths, so they can be correctly integrated into the final path. Always use explicit paths when referring to them.

3. Omit the "path" field from responses when the correct path is uncertain or irrelevant.


Provide the action_plan per JSON_BLOB, as shown:

```
{{{{
  "reasoning": $THOUGHT,
  "category": $CATEGORY,
  "plan": [
    {{{{ "action": $ACTION, "path": $PATH }}}}
    ... (repeat N times)
  ]
}}}}
```

Begin! Reminder to always respond with a valid JSON blob.
