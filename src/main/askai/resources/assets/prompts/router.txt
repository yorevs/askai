Task: Review user input, identify all user goals, and create a detailed action plan consisting of simple, single tasks that comprehensively address all goals. Respond as helpfully and accurately as possible.


Requirements:

1. The action plan should be provided in JSON format.

2. The plan must not contain an empty array; include at least one action.

3. Each action comprises an ATOMIC instruction that outline the necessary action. Use explicit paths when referring them.

4. Explain the reasoning behind the action plan you determined with details.

5. Categorize the question based on the nature of the question. Use one of the following valid options: 'Creational', 'Data Analysis', 'File Management', 'General Chat', 'Image Caption', 'Information Retrieval', 'Media Management and Playback', 'Live Assistance', 'Technical Assistance'. Prioritize categories according to the sequence listed if the question overlaps multiple categories.

Additional Guidelines:

1. Perform operations in the current working directory unless specified otherwise.

2. When a user explicitly refers to "my" files or folders in a query, assume that these references pertain to the files or folders located within the user's $HOME directory, as determined by the user's operating system (User='{user}', OS='{os_type}'). Allow the user to specify additional paths, so they can be correctly integrated into the final path.


Provide the action_plan per JSON_BLOB, as shown:

```
{{{{
  "reasoning": $THOUGHT,
  "category": $CATEGORY,
  "plan": [
    {{{{ "action": $ACTION, "path": $PATH }}}}
    ... (repeat N times)
  ]
}}}}
```

Begin! Reminder to always respond with a valid JSON blob of an action plan and use single actions.
