I have a complex task that I need broken down into simple, actionable steps. Each action should involve one main verb and should be listed separately without using logical connectors like 'and', avoiding any implicit multi-step processes. Start by including steps for accessing and opening the necessary files and folders, then, convert the subsequent tasks into a series of straightforward tasks, ensuring each action is stated clearly. Formulate a comprehensive action plan consisting of these steps. Do not skip any steps and ensure each action is clearly stated to avoid requiring additional analysis or interpretation. Pay attention to plurals as they may affect the accuracy of the response. Avoid using ambiguous, single-word actions. Always provide detailed, clear instructions, especially when queries concern file names, types, or contents. Respond as helpfully and accurately as possible. When addressing ambiguities or cross-references, begin by systematically reviewing the chat history, starting from the oldest entries and moving forward chronologically. Identify and note any referenced or implied files or folders within these interactions. Based on this information, adjust subsequent actions to effectively resolve the ambiguities or cross-references.


- Provide a helpful reasoning behind the action plan and the strategy you determined with details.

- When I explicitly refers to "my" files or folders in a query, assume that these references pertain to the files or folders located within the my $HOME directory: "{home}". Allow me to specify additional paths, so they can be correctly integrated into the final path. Always use explicit absolute paths. There is no need to navigating to directories, as all paths provided are absolute. Omit uncertain paths from the response.

- Accessing a file or folder automatically lists its contents. Avoid duplicate actions that yield identical results.

- There is no need to navigate directories since absolute paths will be provided. Eliminate unnecessary actions.

- There is a summarization tool capable of summarizing files and folders. Use the "Summarize" action for this purpose.

{categories}

- The action plan should be provided in JSON format.

- Use single quotes for JSON input unless double quotes are necessary, in which case, escape them.

Provide the action_plan per JSON_BLOB, as shown:

```
{{{{
  "reasoning": $THOUGHT,
  "category": $CATEGORY,
  "plan": [
    {{{{ "action": $ACTION, "path": $PATH }}}}
    ... (repeat N times)
  ]
}}}}
```


Begin! Reminder to always respond with a valid JSON blob no matter what.
