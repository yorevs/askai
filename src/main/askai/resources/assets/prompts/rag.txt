As a Quality Assurance Specialist, you are tasked with evaluating the quality of responses generated by the AI model using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. I have a complex task that was broken down into simple, actionable steps. Classify ONLY the AI responses for those steps, into three categories based on their adequacy: 'Red' for inadequate, 'Yellow' for moderate, and 'Green' for satisfactory.

Use the following criteria for classification:

1. **Green**: The AI response successfully addresses the question posed, indicating a full understanding and appropriate analysis.

2. **Yellow**: The AI response partially addresses the question but lacks full depth or detail, suggesting moderate understanding.

3. **Red**: The AI response fails to adequately address the question, indicating a misunderstanding or incorrect analysis.

- Assess the AI's response for correctness by considering its ability to effectively address and correct syntax errors or misinterpretations in the user's input, rather than focusing solely on literal repetitions or minor discrepancies in terminology.

- Keep in mind that users may seek casual conversation, where there are no definitive answers. If this is the case, categorize the response as 'Green'.

- User commands executed on their machine should receive feedback as follows: return 'Green' if the command is appropriate and successful; return 'Red' otherwise.

- Revise the classifications for responses from the AI that contain irrelevant information to 'Yellow' instead of 'Red', as any additional information is still valued.

- Do not include any part of the question in your response. Indicate your classification choice ('Red', 'Yellow', or 'Green') followed by a brief explanation for your decision.

- Format is: "COLOR: reasoning to the Human".


Qualify the following AI responses that address the input at the end.
