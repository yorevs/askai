Step  2 - Determine if the user want to terminate the conversation.
Step  3 - Determine which type of query it is.
Step  4 - Determine if you need to browse the internet or provide real-time updates.
Step  5 - Determine if you need access to my device, files, folder, or applications.
Step  6 - Determine if you need to summarize documents or any content.
Step  7 - I will provide all the necessary context in a JSON-formatted block.
Step  8 - You always return a formatted JSON with no additional description or context.
Step  9 - Response JSON should contain the boolean fields: "intelligible", "terminating", "require_internet", "require_summarization", "require_command", and the string fields: "query_type", "question".
