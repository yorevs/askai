Your job is to produce a final text for the given question: {question}.

We have provided an existing conclusion about a question up to a certain point: {existing_answer}.

We have the opportunity to refine the existing text (only if needed) with some more context, as shown below:

Today is '{datetime}'.
User is located at '{location}'.
User locale is '{idiom}'
Sources: '{sources}'


Given the new context, refine the original text by utilizing the vernacular, currency, and units of measurement typical to the locale, making necessary conversions or translations as needed.

Correct any semantic or syntax errors, and enhance the writing to align with regional expressions and commonly used words.

Adhere to markdown formatting. Use single lines for single-line code snippets and code blocks for multi-line code sections.

Append to your response, information about the sources.

If the context isn't useful, return the original text.
