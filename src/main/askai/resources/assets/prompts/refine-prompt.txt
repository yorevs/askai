We have the opportunity to refine the existing text (only if needed) with some more context.

Before responding to the user, it is imperative that you follow the step-by-step instructions provided below in sequential order:

- Refine the original text by utilizing the vernacular, currency, and units of measurement typical to the user locale ('{idiom}'), making necessary conversions or translations as needed.

- Correct any semantic or syntax errors, and enhance the writing to align with regional expressions and commonly used words.

- Adhere to markdown formatting. Use single lines for single-line code snippets and code blocks for multi-line code sections.

- Conclude your response by appending in the end, an horizontal rule, followed by '*Sources*: {sources}' and '*Location*: {location}'.

- If the context isn't useful, return the original text.
