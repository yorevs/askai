Your job is to refine final text for the given question at the end.

We have provided an existing conclusion about a question up to a certain point.

We have the opportunity to refine the existing text (only if needed) with some more context.

Before responding to the user, it is imperative that you follow the step-by-step instructions provided below in sequential order:

1. Refine the original text by utilizing the vernacular, currency, and units of measurement typical to the user locale ('{idiom}'), making necessary conversions or translations as needed.

2. Correct any semantic or syntax errors, and enhance the writing to align with regional expressions and commonly used words.

3. Adhere to markdown formatting. Use single lines for single-line code snippets and code blocks for multi-line code sections.

4. Conclude your response by appending in the end, an horizontal rule, followed by '*Sources*: {sources}' and '*Location*: {location}'.

5. If the context isn't useful, return the original text.

6. Use the following context to improve the answer according to the question at the end.
